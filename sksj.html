  <p>i feel so uncomfortable, heavy and something a part of me is missing, i want to rest na but i don't know how and where. i wish na it would be easy to recover sa ganitong situation but i just cant, i don't have anyone to talk to and i think its better if i keep this to myself since ako lang din makaka iintindi sa sarili ko. although it's been a year since we parted ways, araw araw parin kitang naiisip, i never intended to hurt you, i love you genuinely and hindi ko maalis yung attachment ko sa'yo. you were my home, your presence made me comfortable and u made me understand how to be genuinely in love. i thought things are getting better but it's not, na realize ko na im just distracted sa paligid ko and i tried to force it thinking it would be better for me. but sometimes i feel like na mag b-breakdown na lang ako kahit sa school, kaya this notes are my coping mechanism, to calm myself down para kahit papano ma express ko yung bigat na nararamdaman ko, im just imagining na nag oopen up lang ako sa'yo bcs it's my safe space. pero i wish na i just can talk to you directly, but natatakot ako na baka mas lalo mo akong i hate or ma disgust dahil i keep bothering u, but it's not my intention, i just want to express how i rlly feel. sometimes it feels unbearable kasi im still longing for my comfort. pls do know na that this message is to express and appreciate you, wala akong intention to offend you pero if ma feel mo man, just tell me so i can apologize properly thank you</p>
